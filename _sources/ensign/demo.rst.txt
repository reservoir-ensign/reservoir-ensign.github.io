Demo
====

The demos provide interactive demonstrations of the ENSIGN Python 
functionality.

Jupyter Notebook Demos
----------------------

The notebooks are located in **$ENSIGN_BASE/Ensign-Py3/demo/**

* Tour_of_Ensign-Py3.ipynb

A general tour of functionality provided with Ensign-Py3

* Interpreting_Decompositions.ipynb

Develops understanding of decompositions and how to derive insights from them


Running Jupyter Demos on a Local Machine
----------------------------------------

This is the case when ENSIGN is installed on a machine with a GUI and a 
browser.

::

    cd $ENSIGN_BASE/Ensign-Py3/demo
    jupyter notebook

A browser should appear with a filetree. Click on the demo of choice to begin.


Running Jupyter Demos on a Remote Machine
-----------------------------------------

This is the case when ENSIGN is installed on a remote machine without a GUI 
and browser.

On the remote machine:

::

    cd $ENSIGN_BASE/Ensign-Py3/demo
    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888

On a local machine:

::

    ssh -N -L 8888:localhost:8888 user@host

Then navigate to "localhost:8888" on a local browser.

**Note**: If port 8888 is in use, it can be changed with the `--port` option
and correspondingly in the `ssh` call.

Demo Application
----------------

Demonstrates basic decomposition functionality and the reading and writing of 
tensors when using the Python API.

Located at: **$ENSIGN_BASE/Ensign-Py3/demo/basic/**

::

    cd $ENSIGN_BASE/Ensign-Py3/demo
    python basic/basic.py
